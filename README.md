# EdgeFedPSO (Edge Federated Particle Swarm Optimization)

EdgeFedPSO is an innovative project that implements Federated Learning using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on edge devices. It aims to train machine learning models collaboratively across edge devices while preserving data privacy and minimizing communication overhead.It provides the code for the Research Paper **"An Optimized Machine Learning Technique on Edge Environment : EdgeFedPSO"** 

## Description

EdgeFedPSO leverages the power of federated learning to train machine learning models across edge devices, such as smartphones and IoT devices, without the need to centralize data. The project employs the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to optimize model parameters locally on edge devices while periodically exchanging information with a central server to aggregate global updates.

## Updates

### **Updates in EdgeFedPSO:**

1. **PSO-based Model Update**: 
   The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been integrated into the client-side model updates. Instead of traditional gradient-based updates, each client employs     multiple particles to explore better model parameters, combining cognitive and social terms for better convergence.
2. **Improved Metrics and Aggregation**:
   - Clients now send updated models with precision, recall, and F1-score for enhanced evaluation.
   - Weighted averaging of model parameters uses PSO to fine-tune global model updates.
3. **Global Stopping Condition**:
   - Introduced accuracy threshold (95%) for early stopping during global aggregation.
4. **Efficiency Improvements**:
   - Refined learning rate adjustment and optimized PSO update process for faster convergence.

### **Updates in EdgeFed:**
1. **Device Configuration:**
   - Added `torch.device` for utilizing GPU (`cuda`) if available, improving the performance for training on large datasets.
2. **Dataset Splitting:**
   - In the updated version, `client_dataloaders` are created using subsets of the MNIST dataset for each edge server. This ensures that each server gets a unique portion of the dataset, reflecting a more realistic federated learning setup.
3. **Evaluation on Test Set:**
   - The updated version evaluates both training and test data during each round, providing a more comprehensive performance analysis.
4. **Weighted Average of Model Parameters:**
   - The aggregation function is more explicit in calculating weighted averages of model parameters across clients based on their data size, improving the effectiveness of global model updates.
5. **Enhanced Logging and Metrics:**
   - The updated code logs training and test set metrics (loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for each communication round. This provides more visibility into model performance during training.
6. **Global Model Update:**
   - The new implementation ensures that the global model is updated directly using the aggregated local modelsâ€™ state_dicts, improving synchronization across clients.
7. **Storage of Results:**
   - Enhanced result-saving capabilities, storing evaluation metrics (accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1-score) after each round in `.pkl` files, making it easier to analyze training progression later.


## Key Features

## Installation

To use the EdgeFedPSO project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/EdgeFedPSO.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up the edge devices where you want to deploy the federated learning framework.
4. Configure the parameters such as the number of edge servers, clients per server, local batch size, learning rate, etc., according to your requirements.
5. Prepare the dataset for federated learning. Ensure that it is divided into subsets for each edge device.
6. Run the project to start federated learning: `python edge_fed_pso.py`.
7. Monitor the training progress and global model updates.

## Usage

1. Define your machine learning model architecture and objective function in the `Model` class.
2. Implement the `calculate_gradient` function to compute local gradients on each edge device.
3. Execute the `EdgeUpdate` function to perform local model updates on each edge device.
4. Run the `GlobalAggregation` function to aggregate global model updates periodically.

## Troubleshooting

- If the training process does not converge or encounters errors, try adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, or PSO parameters.
- Ensure that the edge devices have sufficient computational resources and data samples for training.
- Debug any issues related to communication between edge devices and the central server.
